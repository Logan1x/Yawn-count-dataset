# Yawn-count-dataset

### Context

There's a story behind every dataset and here's mine,
One of my professor takes too many yawns in the class, Every time it happens we get distracted from the topic and feel sleepy. To make the class more interesting, I started taking yawn count initially but as time went on, I got bored and stopped taking observations. 

One fine day I was regretting the decision to stop counting, I looked at the previous data and found out that the range of yawns is 3 -11 So, I generated random data in the range of 3-11 for this dataset.



### Acknowledgements

I want to thank my prof and my boredom for this dataset.
